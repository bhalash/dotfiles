# Dotfiles
My dotfiles. ðŸ§™ This project replaces my old separate projects:

- https://github.com/bhalash/tmux
- https://github.com/bhalash/vim
- https://github.com/bhalash/zsh

vim was my primary driver for this, as I change my configuration all the time.

## Setup
This project is managed by [Dotbot](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot).

```shell
git clone --recursive https://github.com/bhalash/dotfiles ~/.dotfiles
cd ~/.dotfiles
./install
```
